## Abstract
> This thesis describes the foundations of generative artificial intelligence with a detailed explanation of three generative models – variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models – and their applications. Furthermore, it discusses the risks and challenges of generative models and the proposed regulation of AI worldwide. It also investigates whether people can identify AI-generated images of faces.
> 
> An online survey (N = 333) was conducted to test people's ability to distinguish between real and fake faces. The average accuracy of participants was 59.9% (95% confidence
interval [58.1%, 61.8%]), which is above chance performance of 50% and is in line with previous research. The analysis showed that having experience with generative AI tools
improved the detection ability with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) in the means of the inexperienced and experienced samples. The analysis showed no significant difference in accuracy across various screen sizes on which the participants viewed the faces.
> 
> Seven online tools for detecting AI-generated images were tested, identifying one high- performing tool. In another experiment, three automated machine learning models were trained to classify real and AI-generated faces, which showed that although progress has been made in AutoML image classification, the models were not robust enough and underperformed the best online tool.
